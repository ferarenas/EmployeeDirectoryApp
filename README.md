# EmployeeDirectoryApp

## Build tools & versions used
Xcode 14.1
iPhone SE Simulator iOS 16.1

## Steps to run the app
The app should be able to just run/build once the packages are loaded.
Although, in order to test the functionality of valid, malformed and empty urls, the user needs to go into the AppCoordinator.swift and uncomment the case that would like to be tested on the showEmployeeList function.
Only one case can be uncommented at a time and the app needs to be re-run after.

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
On the app setup and functionality.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
I tried to fulfill the minimum requirements without going to far passed the suggested allotted time
